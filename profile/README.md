# About Proception AI

**Built Like a Machine. Works Like a Human.**

Proception AI is pioneering the future of dexterity in robotics, where robotics and AI merge to redefine the limits of machines and the potential of humans. Based in Palo Alto, CA, we're backed by Y Combinator and focused on creating the next generation of robotic hands.

## Our Mission

We're developing **ProHand** - the new frontier of dexterity that achieves human-like precision in handling delicate objects and performing fine motor tasks. Where traditional robots can't, ProHand can.

### Building the Full Stack of Physical Intelligence

Our mission is to create a complete ecosystem of physical intelligence, from hardware to AI, solving complex manipulation challenges through the best vertical integration approach. We're not just building individual components - we're architecting an entire system that seamlessly integrates:

- **Hardware Innovation**: Advanced anthropomorphic hands with human-like dexterity
- **AI Integration**: Intelligent control systems that learn and adapt in real-time
- **Vertical Integration**: Complete control over the entire stack for optimal performance

### Solving Teleoperation Through Anthropomorphic Excellence

We're tackling one of robotics' most challenging problems: teleoperation. Our approach centers on building the world's best anthropomorphic hands and manipulation platforms that enable:

- **Natural Control**: Intuitive teleoperation that feels like using your own hands
- **Precision Platforms**: Advanced manipulation systems that bridge the gap between human intention and robotic execution
- **Seamless Integration**: Hardware and software working in perfect harmony for superior performance

## ProHand â€” The Future of Dexterity

Our flagship product, ProHand, represents a breakthrough in robotic manipulation with advanced features:

### ðŸŽ¯ Precise Manipulation
